          planning and task distribution, and active correspondence on Telegram. This ensured our alignment, motivation,
          and, of course, the successful outcome of the project. We are a true team where each member has contributed to

            <p>Siarhei, our team leader. He didn't just guide the team, he created a magical synergy among us. His
              experience in project development and coordination was a key factor in our success. Even the long,
              late-night hours he spent juggling warehouse work with development couldn't break his warrior spirit.
              Alongside us, Sergey actively participated in creating the catalog, product pages, shopping cart,
              environment setup, and testing.</p>
